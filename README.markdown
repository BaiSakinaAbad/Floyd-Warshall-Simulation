# Floyd-Warshall Simulation

This is a machine problem task for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. This project implements a visualization of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface.
## Reference
This visualization is inspired on the existing visualization on [Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs Shortest Path](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Floyd.html)
